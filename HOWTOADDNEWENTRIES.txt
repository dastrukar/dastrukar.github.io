This is just a simple guide to adding new entries into the "Stuff that I made" list.

To add a new entry, start with:
<div class='container faded'>

Next, an icon should be used as a button that links to the project.
It should also use a class called: a.nohover
<a title='example' href='https://lorem.ipsum' class='nohover' target='_blank'> 
The icon should use an id called: #icon
<img src=image.jpg class='rounded' id='icon'></img>
Don't forget to close it off with a: </a>

Next, a description should be used, with an id of: #text
<p id='text'>
    Lorem <br />
    Ipsum.</p>

Once you're done with that, make sure to add: </div>

Congrats! You've just added a new entry ;p
